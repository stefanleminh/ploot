<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Ploot will help you create breakout-sessions (that you can use for gaming for example) in your discord server. You can add, remove players or spectators, randomize two teams of 6 people and move them into designated voice channels when you start/end the match.
No more using randomize websites and moving each player back and forth one by one!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stefanleminh/ploot.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Enter your configuration in `config.json`
4. Run with

   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

Start a new session with `=newsession` - You can now add/remove players or any other functionality that comes with ploot. Ploot will now listen to any user that will join the lobby and add them to the list of players automatically. To manually add a player or spectator (or multiple!) you can use `=addplayer @DiscordUser ...` or `=addspectator @DiscordUser ...` respectively or and to remove them use `=remove @DiscordUser ...`. You can also switch their mode with `=switchmode @DiscordUser`
You can then create your teams by using the `=randomize` command - It will purge any players not present in the lobby. Then you can use `=startmatch` to move every player in the lobby to their designated voice-channel and back to the lobby with `=endmatch`.  
Finally, you can end the session with `=endsession`.
