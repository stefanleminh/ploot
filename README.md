<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Ploot will help you create breakout-sessions (that you can use for gaming for example) in your discord server. You can add, remove players or spectators, randomize two teams of 6 people and move them into designated voice channels when you start/end the match.
No more using randomize websites and moving each player back and forth one by one!

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stefanleminh/ploot.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Enter your configuration in `config.json` (refer to [Configuration](#configuration))
4. Run with

   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

#### Configuration

You have to create a config.json file in the root directory. It will need the following properties:

```json
{
  "token": "", // Bot-Token
  "loggingLevel": "info", // Logging-Level
  "testGuildId": "" // Server-ID to employ commands on guild-level (will deploy globally if empty)
}
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

1. Configure the bot with `/configure`. Currently you will have to set the lobby VC, first team's VC and second team's VC.
1. Start a new session with `/newsession` - Ploot will now create roles for spectators and the teams that are pre-configured in the config.
   - Any player in the lobby will be a player unless you specifically give them the spectator role, either manually or via the `/switchmode` command.
1. You can then create your teams by using the `/randomize` command - It will ignore bots and only look at the members connected to the lobby-vc.
1. Then you can use `/startmatch` to move every player in the lobby to their designated voice-channel and back to the lobby with `/endmatch`.
1. Finally, you can end the session with `/endsession`.
